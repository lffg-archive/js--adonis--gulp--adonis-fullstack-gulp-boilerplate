# Fullstack Boilerplate (AdonisJs)

A fork of [`adonis-fullstack-app`](https://github.com/adonisjs/adonis-fullstack-app) with some changes, such as:

- **Main changes**:
  - Some view globals;
  - Some HTTP exceptions validation (such as 401, 404 and 500).
- **Developer Environment Changes**:
  - Gulp included (for compiling static assets, like ES6 JS or SCSS);
  - ESLint included (with the AdonisJs preferences).
